## (week 1) Neural Networks
- **(Deep Learning Algorithms)**
- Neural Networks intuition
    - Neurons and the brain
        - **Learn how to make better decisions on how to approach practical Deep Learning Algoritms**
        - Neural Netowrks first impacted speech recognition, images (computer vision), text (natural language processing).

        - hidden layer
            - Each neuron has access to every feature and value from the previous layer
            - it figures out which features to use automatically by setting the parameters appropriately
        - multiple hidden layers

            - neural network architecture
                - How many layers do you want
                - how many neurons in each layer
