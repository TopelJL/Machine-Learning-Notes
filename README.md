# Stanford-Notes

#### Notes
- This repo serves as my personal collection of notes in my journey of machine Learning. Feel free to take any of these notes for your own personal use.
- The code provided in files is capable of being run fully in a jupyter notebook. I replicated as best as I could for python using visual studio code for practicing purposes.
- The OneNote contains many equations, calculations, and concepts for my own personal use. However, I tried to keep it as clean and easy to follow as possible.
