# Stanford-Notes

This repo serves as my personal collection of notes in my journey of machine Learning. Feel free to take any of these notes for your own personal use.

#### The OneNote contains many equations, calculations, and concepts for my own personal use. However, I tried to keep it as clean and easy to follow as possible.
