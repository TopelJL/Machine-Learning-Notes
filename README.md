# Machine Learning Notes

#### Notes
- This repo serves as my personal collection of notes in my journey of machine Learning. Feel free to take any of these notes for your own personal use.
- The code provided in files is capable of being run fully in a jupyter notebook. I replicated as best as I could for python using visual studio code for practicing purposes.
- The OneNote contains many equations, calculations, and concepts for my own personal use. However, I tried to keep it as clean and easy to follow as possible.

**Quick Note**
- Roughly halfway through my second week of this course i discovered I could download all the labs, and the whole point of coding the labs in here was for documentation and later reference purposes. All labs can be found in the section Coursera code and truthfully will be much easier to follow and understand than my own code.
